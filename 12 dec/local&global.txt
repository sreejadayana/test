JavaScript:

JavaScript is a scripting language which can be used to develop dynamic front end web pages and also 
write server side applications.

Brendan developed JavaScript while working with Netscape company on a project (Netscape Navigator).

Initally JS was called as LiveScript, then later changed the name to JavaScript. 

ECMA (European Computers Manufacturers Association) standardized Javascript so JS can also be called as 
ECMAScript (ES5,ES6,ES7).

Variables: 
Variables are identifiers to store / refer / identify some data / values. 

syntax: 
 var var_name = value; 
 var age = 21; 
 var username ="kiran123" 
 var password= "djfvldfnvldnfv" 
 var mobile = 9010101010

Note: As a developer, if we want to know how far our logic is working, we can console log the intermediate 
results. 

console.log();
  var name="digital lync"; 
               var address= "Hitech City, Opp to Cyber Towers!";
               console.log(name);
               console.log(address);

There are two types of variables.

1. Local Variables : A variable that is enclosed in a function is known as local variable. 
Local variables can be accessed only with in the function. 

function login(){
                    var username= "dl";  // Local variable
                    var password= "lync"; // Local Variable
                    console.log(username); 
                    console.log(password);
                  }
                  login();
                  console.log(username); // error

2. Global Variables: 
Any variable that is created outside of a function, then it is considered as global variable. 

                   var x=100; //global variable 
                   var y=200; // global variable. 
                   function f1(){
                       console.log(x);  // 100
                       console.log(y); // 200
                       x=900;
                   }
                    console.log(x); // 100
                   f1();
                   console.log(x); // 900
                   
Local and Global example: 

var x=100;
                   function f1(){
                    var x=2;
                       console.log(x);  // 2
                       x=9; //
                   }
                    console.log(x); // 100
                   f1();
                   console.log(x); // 100
